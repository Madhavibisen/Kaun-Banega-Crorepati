# Kaun-Banega-Crorepati
Hello Everyone! You all must have watched or heard about the very famous Television game show called KBC(Kaun Banega Crorepati), originally Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. I have used Pygame module of Python 3 to create the game. Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries that are designed to be used with the Python programming language. So, before proceeding further, make sure you have Python 3 and Pygame module installed in your system. First, we need to define question data set consisting of questions, options and its correct answers. You can create a custom question data set in a separate .json file.
